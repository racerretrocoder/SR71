          NOTE: Throttle 51% + Engages the afterburner
          First Contact with Spacebird
          Now you are sitting in the Pilot cockpit
          On the Forward Cockpit if Blackbird   SR71-A
          With view "7" you can see the RSO cockpit (not yet with equipemnts)
          On the Rear Cockpit if Blackbird   SR71-B  training
          With view "7" you can see the Pilot Student cockpit
          The Electric Master is OFF
          The Engines is "cut off" ON
          The canopy are "open"
          The Parking Brake is ON

          ====Start Routine==========
          Electric Master Switch On => key "}"
          Get the external Starter ressources  with "s" key
          Engines will start up!
          the engines are started around 10% RPM
          Don't forget to close the canopy key => "d"
          the engines start at 10% rpm
          Parking brake Off
          then push the throttle to 50% for take off
          The afterburner is very powerful, do not use full power on the ground
          
          Run on ground until 180 kts take off  before 210 kts 
          (above you will damage the tyres)
          Try to get off the ground before 210kts
          Retrect the gear. Fly!

          ====Space flight / Orbit=================
          First climb to around 44,000ft
          At this altitude the planes drag will sharply reduce to allow for orbital velocity! Enjoy. 
          Continue to accelerate and climb higher!
          As you start to approach the Carmen line (100,000ft) the airflow around the aircraft will reduce control surface effectiveness be careful with the aircrafts controls!
          Enable Earth View Orbital Rendering in the view menu for the best result 
          The reaction wheels will automatically enable. which will allow you to manuver the craft while in 0 gravity 
          Continue to increase speed
          Watch your Apoapsis (AP) on the HUD, Or MFD. and Aim for around 500,000ft
          Once you've hit the Apoapsis at that height shut down the engines (Optional, Or set throttle to idle!) And cruise powerless to your apoapsis altitude
          Once your at your apoapsis altitude and vertical speed is near 0,  restart the engines (if you disabled them) then Push full Afterburner, going prograde (flying straight) to increase your speed to around mach 26
          Watch your Periapsis (PE) on the HUD, Or MFD and aim it around 400,000ft+
          If your AP goes too high (above 500,000ft) Try pitching down and burning to reduce the APs alt and increase the PE even more.
          When your PE and AP altitudes are above 400,000ft then congrats! You are orbiting around the earth!
          TURN OFF YOUR ENGINES While in orbital cruise. THIS IS NESSORY Press } to turn off elec, then turn elec back on with } the engines will shut down.

          Apoapsis is the highest point of the orbit
          Periapsis is the lowest point of the orbit 
          While burning to increase periapsis. If your apoapsis grows. try pitching down at earth and burning.
          If you fail. Orbit all the way around to the Periapsis and burn retrograde (burn flying backwards) to decrease your apoapsis
          
          Try to keep both above 400,000ft

          GOOD ORBIT SPEEDS AND ALTS:
          Velocity ~ Mach 29
          AP ~ 450kFT
          PE ~ 450kFT

          ====Changing orbit=========
          You can turn your heading by changing the inclanation of the orbit
          To do this. you must burn right or left from prograde
          This will slowly change the inclination of the orbit
         


          ====Refueling============
          ONLY  On gound refueling, if Airspeed less than 20 kts
          With Hotspot on Panel => transferswitch LMB => ON or MMB => OFF

          ONLY Air refueling if Airspeed more than 200 kts and Agl more  than 300 feet
          With Hotspot on Panel => transfer switch LMB => ON or MMB => OFF
                AND
          With "F" Key which open the Doors
          need refuel contact with Tanker
          (indicated by  the green light "ON" on left top of the radar )
          
          ====Landing==============
          Final approach speed  kias 185,
          landing speed 165 kias.
          
          ====Braking Chute==========
          the braking chute will be automaticlly deployed
          When the following conditions are all true

          Brake Chute doors are openeded  => key "Ctrl-b"
          Gear on Runway
          Throttle position less than 0.3

          the braking chute will be released, untied
          When
          Airspeed less than 60 kts
          REMEMBER       it can be used only once
          If you want it again you must reload it =>  key "j"

         =====JAL========================
         Rocket asisted landing can be deployed by pressing the trigger on your joystick
         (Military trigger)
         Use it to slow down quickly when landing on short runways!


          ====Radar================
          That Radar is the last version ("Vivian" Radar )
           you can choose the range by clicking on the switch
           =>mouse button 1 to decrease =>mouse button 0 to increase

          ====Tacan================
          The Tacan instrument is situated or the left side of the cockpit
          That instrument is fully operationnal, look at the hotspot to enter the right values
          ====Autopilot==============
          The autopilot can be ON/OFF with Altitude and Heading
           with key => "Ctrl A"  (toggle ON/OF) for the current Altitude
        <!--  with key => "Ctrl H"  (toggle ON/OF) for the choosen bug heading on your HSI instrument    -->
